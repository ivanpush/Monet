# Monet — VS Code Extension

Terminal-native AI session manager. No webview, no panel. Colors terminals by project, auto-renames them from agent status files, reconnects sessions after Extension Host restarts.

## How It Works
- Paintcan button in terminal toolbar → New Session / Continue
- Each session gets unique 8-char hex `sessionId` (e.g., `f7ee09cf`)
- Hooks baked into `.claude/settings.local.json` update status on Claude events
- Agent writes `~/.monet/status/{sessionId}.json` → poll loop renames terminal
- Terminal name format: `{emoji} — {title}` (e.g., `🟢 — Fixing auth bug`)
- PID stored in status file for reconnection after Extension Host restart

## Key Files
- `src/extension.ts` — entry point, registers commands, activates managers
- `src/types.ts` — SessionMeta, SessionStatusFile, STATUS_EMOJI, PROJECT_COLORS
- `src/sessionManager.ts` — creates sessions, tracks terminals, PID-based reconnection
- `src/projectManager.ts` — scans ~/Projects, assigns colors per project path
- `src/statusWatcher.ts` — fs.watch + poll loop, renames terminals from status files
- `src/hooksManager.ts` — installs/removes Claude Code hooks in project settings
- `src/hooksInstaller.ts` — installs ~/.monet/bin scripts (monet-status, monet-title)

## Rules
- Async IO only (`fs.promises`). Sync blocks UI thread.
- Atomic file writes: write to `.tmp`, then `fs.rename()`.
- `fs.watch` for ~/.monet/status/. VS Code watchers unreliable outside workspace.
- try/catch everything. Never crash on bad data.
- Never touch user's CLAUDE.md.

## Status Emoji (4 states)
- 🔵 `thinking` — processing user prompt
- 🟢 `active` — using tools
- 🟡 `waiting` — needs user input/permission
- ⚪ `idle` — done, waiting for next prompt

## Session Tracking
- `sessionId`: 8-char hex UUID, unique per session, never changes
- `MONET_SESSION_ID` env var set on terminal creation for slash commands
- Status file: `~/.monet/status/{sessionId}.json`
- Hooks: `~/.monet/bin/monet-status {sessionId} {status}`
- Slots 1-20 used internally for limiting concurrent sessions

## Persistence
- `globalState 'monet.sessions'` → in-memory session metadata
- `~/.monet/status/{sessionId}.json` → disk-based session state:
  - `sessionId`, `project`, `status`, `title`, `updated`
  - `processId` — terminal PID for reconnection
  - `projectPath` — full path for fallback matching

## Reconnection (Extension Host Restart)
On activation, `reconnectSessions()` reads disk status files and matches to live terminals:
1. Primary: match `terminal.processId` === `statusFile.processId`
2. Fallback: match `terminal.cwd` === `statusFile.projectPath`

## Colors
Custom Monet palette defined in `package.json` contributes.colors:
`monet.waterLily`, `monet.gardenMint`, `monet.roseFloral`, `monet.sunlightGold`, etc.
Each project path gets assigned next available color index.

## Target Editor
Building for Cursor (VS Code fork). Install via `cursor --install-extension monet-*.vsix`.

## Build when updating 
```bash
npm run compile    # esbuild → dist/extension.js
npm run package    # vsce package → .vsix
```

**Always add to BUILD_LOG.md when making changes.** If a change completely rethinks a prior entry (not just builds on it), annotate that prior entry with 
  a forward-reference to the new one so it's not read as current.    

Very important. Any time you're looking at adding features, any time you're looking at generating code, look at all the possible systems that are affected:
- Starting with the container the code is in
- Followed by the general section
- Followed by the entire file
- Followed by the entire abstract functionality  Make sure none of the systems are modified whatsoever except the intended target.Triple check your thinking each time. Unless it's obviously simple.If you're not sure, look up documentation if it's there.Give me a very short response in your planning on why this is completely safe.
-Trace agt least 10 user interaction lines to see if any conflicts or issues arise. check things like, title state, save state, pid, etc
